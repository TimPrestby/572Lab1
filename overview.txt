-Pollination and fragmentation?

POLLINATION

This map layer depicts the total acres of agricultural crops within a subwatershed (12-digit HUC) that require or would benefit from the presence of pollinators, 
but are without any nearby supporting habitat for 2006-2010.

NATCLASS
This map illustrates the percent of land within each subwatershed that is covered by small patches of natural areas for 2006-2010.
 Small natural areas are less 500 acres and covered by forests, shrubs, grasslands, barren land, or wetlands.
 It excludes areas that are covered by agriculture and developed land.





CRP
This map portrays the acres of land within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) that are enrolled in the US Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). 
The CRP is a program administered by the Farm Service Agency; 
farmers in the program receive annual payments and establishment cost share 
The money goes to remove environmentally sensitive land from crop production and instead plant perennial species that provide environmental benefits.
