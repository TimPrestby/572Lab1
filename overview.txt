-Pollination and fragmentation?

POLLINATION

This map layer depicts the total acres of agricultural crops within a subwatershed (12-digit HUC) that require or would benefit from the presence of pollinators, 
but are without any nearby supporting habitat for 2006-2010.

NATCLASS
This map illustrates the percent of land within each subwatershed that is covered by small patches of natural areas for 2006-2010.
 Small natural areas are less 500 acres and covered by forests, shrubs, grasslands, barren land, or wetlands.
 It excludes areas that are covered by agriculture and developed land.
