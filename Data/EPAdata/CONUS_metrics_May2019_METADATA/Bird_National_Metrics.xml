Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems, have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, or cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 15 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for bird species. Metrics include all bird species richness, lists identifying species of conservation concern, climate vulnerabilities, etc. This dataset was produced by the Center for Applied Spatial Ecology, New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Unit (NMCFWRU), NMSU to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.  EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract><purpose>The biodiversity metrics were created by grouping national-level, single-species habitat models created by the USGS Gap Analysis Program into smaller, ecologically-based, phylogeny-based, or stakeholder-suggested composites. This data could be used in conjunction with other biodiversity data or ecosystem service data to identify concordance and discordance between metrics. Areas of concordance highlight the similarity between the two metrics. Areas of discordance highlight dissimilar areas, but must then be reviewed to understand why the dissimilarity occurs. The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose></descript><secinfo><secsys>https://project-open-data.github.io/schema/#accessLevel</secsys><secclass>public</secclass><sechandl>Standard Technical Controls</sechandl></secinfo><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development-Sustainable and Healthy Communities Research Program, EnviroAtlas</cntorg><cntper>EnviroAtlas Coordinator</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Geospatial Data Owner</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>109 T.W.

DESCRIPTIONS:

			-Bird Species Richness:	
			The number of bird species as measured by predicted habitat present within a pixel. Bird Species Richness provides a characterization of the area of interest. Bird Species Richness can be indicative of recreational opportunities or aesthetic qualities. Birding is a multimillion dollar a year industry and tourist brochures often highlight the recreational opportunities available within an area. Bird Species Richness has been used as a major indicator of the biodiversity conservation potential of an area. It is important to ecological service categories related to biodiversity conservation and recreation, culture, and aesthetics. Source: U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program. 2011. National GAP vertebrate species distribution model. http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/species.

			-Bird Species of Conservation Concern:
			The number of birds listed in the State of the Birds report (2011) as species of conservation concern as measured by predicted habitat present within a pixel for the continental United States. This is based on the listings designated by the USFWS in their Birds of Conservation Concern 2007 and 2008 WatchList. The WatchList was created by the American Bird Conservancy and Audubon. Birds of Conservation Concern (n=160) (State of the Birds, 2011).
			North American Bird Conservation Initiative, U.S. Committee, 2011. The State of the Birds 2011 Report.

			-Birds Species Partners in Flight:
			The number of birds listed by Partners in Flight in their Watch List as measured by predicted habitat present within a pixel within the continental United States (n=154). 

			-Bird Species Breeding:
			This metric is comprised of the number of birds listed in the State of the Birds report (2011) as having a single primary habitat (habitat obligate) for breeding. Species are measured by predicted habitat present within a pixel within the continental United States. (State of the Birds, 2011).

			-Bird Species Wetlands:
			This metric is comprised of the number of birds (n=152) listed in the State of the Birds report (2011) as having a single primary habitat (habitat obligate) of Wetlands. Species are measured by predicted habitat present within a pixel within the continental United States (State of the Birds, 2011).

			-Bird Species Audubon Endangered:
			The Audubon society analyzed 588 bird species to determine the effects of future climate change on these species (National Audubon Society, 2013). This list classifies species as Endangered 1 or Endangered 2. Audubon defined ENDANGERED_1 as species with a loss of 50% or more of current range by 2050 without compensatory expansion in one season. Audubon defined ENDANGERED_2 as the loss of 50% or more of current range by 2050 without compensatory expansion in two seasons. This metrics combines both lists for a total number of 127 species.

			-Bird Species Audubon Threatened:
			The Audubon society analyzed 588 bird species to determine the effects of future climate change on these species. This metric includes species listed as Threatened 1 or Threatened 2. Audubon defined THREATENED_1 as the loss of 50% or more of current range by 2080 with potential for compensatory expansion in one season. Audubon defined THREATENED_2 as the loss of 50% or more of current range by 2080 with potential for compensatory expansion in two seasons. This metrics combines both lists for a total number of 183 species.

			Future Climate Change on Species: A Tool for the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. Unpublished report prepared for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

			-Bird Species G1, G2, G3 listed:
			This metric is comprised of the number of birds listed by NatureServe as G1, G2, or G3. G1= Critically Imperiled—At very high risk of extinction due to extreme rarity (often 5 or fewer populations), very steep declines, or other factors. G2= Imperiled—At high risk of extinction due to very restricted range, very few populations (often 20 or fewer), steep declines, or other factors. G3= Vulnerable—At moderate risk of extinction due to a restricted range, relatively few populations (often 80 or fewer), recent and widespread declines, or other factors. Species are measured by predicted habitat present within a pixel for the continental United States.

			-Bird Species IUCN listed:
			This metric is comprised of the number of birds (n=52) listed by IUCN as extinct, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, or near threatened. Extinct (EX) = A taxon is Extinct when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died. A taxon is presumed Extinct when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual. Surveys should be over a time frame appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form. Critically Endangered (CR) = A taxon is Critically Endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Critically Endangered (see http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1), and it is therefore considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. Endangered (EN) = A taxon is Endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Endangered (see http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1), and it is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. Vulnerable (VU) = A taxon is Vulnerable when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Vulnerable (see http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1), and it is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. Near Threatened (NT)=A taxon is Near Threatened when it has been evaluated against the criteria but does not qualify for Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable now, but is close to qualifying for or is likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near future. Species are measured by predicted habitat present within a pixel for the continental United States.

			-Bird Species Threatened and Endangered Vertebrate Species: 
			Number of Federally-listed Threatened and Endangered (T&amp;E) Species as measured by predicted habitat present within a pixel (USFWS, 2011). Important to ecological service categories related to biodiversity conservation and recreation, culture, and aesthetics. These species are regulated by the USFWS as required by the Endangered Species Act.
